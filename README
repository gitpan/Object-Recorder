Object-Recorder

This module makes it possible to record method calls issued to a set of objects
inti a serializable container which can later be replayed, perfoming the actual
method calls.

This can be useful for several reasons. For instance, it could be used in the
creation of task objects which would then be processed by a cluster of worker
servers, without the need to update the worker code for each new type of task.

It seems that this feature could also be useful in some sort of caching scheme 
besides being useful in distributed systems in general.
